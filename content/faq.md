### Is there an easy way to flash the image of HypriotOS onto a SD card?
Yes, check out our [flash tool](https://github.com/hypriot/flash), which makes the flashing process super easy and fast.

### Default Credentials
The default credentials for the image are pirate/hypriot

### Connection via SSH to a fresh HypriotOS, I get `connection reset by peer`.
