As you all know tomorrow will be a really special day.

__We will celebrate the 3rd Docker birthday.__

And of course we from Hypriot are in the thick of it.

We had to find a suitable location (we now have space for 450 people), prepare the location and computers for all the attendees,
make a birthday cake, learn all about Docker so we could be mentors and finally we had to find sponsors ...

And we actually found some and want to say thank you here for their support:

We thank __Paessler AG__ for the Birthday Cake:

We thank __Seal Systems__ AG for the yummy pizza:

Please drop them a line at their twitter account and give them a virtual hug!

So we mostly finished our preparations and are super excited.

If you have not yet decided if you want to come, here are some reasons:

- a totally free Docker Training
- the best Mentors you can find in good old Germany
- a special kind of Pizza that you usually will only get in Italy
- a really one-of-its-kind birthday cake

And to wet your appetite some more we have prepared some pictures:
